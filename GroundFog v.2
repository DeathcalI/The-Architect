// Ground Fog Spawner V2
// Works with Rockhaunt's Fog FSM Script.
// This current spawner will create an area of fog around COORDS 26-76 and surrounding grids on LINGOR.
// Make sure the path on the execVM for the Fog.fsm file is correct.
// This script is run client-side, so it can't be wrapped in if isServer brackets.
// Might be a huge performance hit for people that can't render clouds well.
// Spawner by Architect.
